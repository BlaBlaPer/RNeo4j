## Contribute Code

### Update the README

If you want to add to or edit the README, make sure you make your changes in `README.Rmd`. This is an [R Markdown](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf) file, which is converted to `README.md` with `make readme`. Once you've ran `make readme`, you can open the `README.md` file in RStudio and preview it with the "Preview HTML" button at the top.

### Modify Existing Code

If you're modifying existing code, just use `make test` to ensure you haven't broken any existing functionality. If applicable, add some tests.

### Add New Code

If you're adding a new function, add a new file to the `R` directory where the name of the file is the name of the function. Look at the other files in the `R` directory for an example. You'll also need to document your function with `roxygen` syntax and add tests.

## Add Tests

Tests are located in the `tests/testthat` directory. Check out some of the current test files for examples of how to use it. Add tests to any of the existing test files in the `tests` directory or add a new test file for your tests if they don't fit into any of the current test file categories. The filename must be prefixed `test-`.

## Run Tests

Run tests with `make test`. Neo4j must be running in order to run the tests.
